Analyzing a bipartite network of escorts and their clients can provide valuable insights into
the dynamics and patterns of the sex industry. To make the most of your dataset,
you can consider asking various questions and exploring different aspects of the network.
Here are some possible questions to get you started:

Network Structure:

What is the size of the network in terms of the number of escorts and clients?
Are there any hubs (highly connected escorts or clients) in the network?
What is the density of the network? How connected are the escorts and clients?
Escort Ratings:

What is the distribution of ratings given by clients? Are there more positive, negative, or neutral ratings?
Can you identify any patterns in the ratings based on the timestamps?
Are there any escorts with consistently high ratings? What sets them apart?
Client Behavior:

Do clients tend to purchase sexual services from multiple escorts or stick to a few favorites?
Can you identify any cliques or clusters of clients who frequently interact with each other?
Are there any specific attributes or characteristics of clients associated with their purchasing behavior or ratings?
Network Evolution:

How has the network evolved over time? Are there any changes in the number of interactions or ratings?
Can you identify any significant events or trends that affected the network dynamics?
Are there any escorts or clients who have joined or left the network during the observed period?
Edge Attributes:

Are there any additional attributes associated with the edges, such as location or cost of services?
Can you uncover any correlations between these attributes and the ratings or purchasing behavior?
Network Visualization:

Can you create visualizations to represent the network structure and highlight interesting patterns or clusters?
Are there any notable differences in the network structure or behavior across different regions or cities in Brazil?
Remember, these questions are just a starting point. Depending on your specific research objectives and the
available data, you can tailor and expand upon these questions to gain deeper insights into the network of escorts
and clients in Brazil.

Social Network Analysis:

What is the overall network structure of the escort-client interactions? Are there any specific patterns, such as small-world properties or community structures?
How does the network's degree distribution look like? Is it a power-law distribution, indicating the presence of influential escorts or clients?
Are there any structural holes in the network, indicating potential opportunities for information or resource flow?
Social Dynamics:

How does the network change over time? Are there any patterns of stability or volatility in the interactions between escorts and clients?
Can you identify any key actors or influential individuals within the network? How do their behaviors and interactions impact the overall dynamics?
Are there any changes in the ratings given by clients over time? What factors might contribute to these changes?
Social Norms and Stigma:

Are there any social norms or stigmas associated with engaging in the sex industry that can be observed through the network data?
Do escorts or clients exhibit any behaviors that indicate conformity to or defiance of these norms?
How do the ratings given by clients reflect or reinforce societal attitudes towards sex work?
Gender and Power Dynamics:

Are there any gender differences in the network, such as the ratio of male to female escorts or the characteristics of clients who engage with different genders?
Do power dynamics, such as the age or socioeconomic status of clients, influence the interactions and ratings in the network?
Can you identify any patterns of vulnerability or exploitation within the network based on the available data?
Geographic Analysis:

Are there any spatial patterns in the network, such as regional variations in the density or composition of the network?
How does the location of escorts and clients relate to their interactions and ratings? Are there any factors specific to certain regions that influence these dynamics?
Online Communities and Information Flow:

How do online communities, like the Brazilian online community for ratings, shape the interactions and behaviors within the network?
Can you identify any influential users or moderators within the online community who impact the information flow and decisions made by clients?
Do certain types of information or discussions within the online community lead to changes in the network dynamics?
